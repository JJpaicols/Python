# Python Repository – Learning Path (Basic → Advanced)

## Description

This repository contains a **school project folder** dedicated to the **study and development of knowledge of the Python programming language**, with code examples that follow a **progressive learning path**, from **basic** concepts to **advanced** topics.

The files are designed to guide the student step by step, helping to understand not only how the code works, but also why it works in that way.

---

## Repository Objectives

* Learn Python starting from the **fundamental basics**
* Gradually develop skills up to **intermediate and advanced** concepts
* Provide clear and practical examples
* Make the code **accessible and understandable to everyone**
* Encourage self-study and experimentation

---

## Code Philosophy

The files in this repository are **self-explanatory codes**:

* The code is written in a **clear and readable** way
* **Explanatory comments** are included
* Variable and function names are **meaningful**
* Each script has a specific **educational purpose**

The goal is not only to make the program work, but to **understand what happens line by line**.

---

## General Structure

The repository may include (or will include over time) files related to:

* Python basic syntax
* Variables and data types
* Input and output
* Conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Functions
* Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
* Error handling
* Modular programming
* Advanced concepts (for example object-oriented programming, file handling, and libraries)

Each file represents a **step in the learning path**.

---

## Accessibility

This repository is **public** and allows **viewing by everyone**, including:

* Students
* Teachers
* Programming enthusiasts
* Anyone interested in learning Python

It is intended as **educational material** and study support.
